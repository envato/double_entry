module DoubleEntry

  # This is the table to end all tables!
  #
  # Every financial transaction gets two entries in here: one for the source
  # account, and one for the destination account. Normal double-entry
  # accounting principles are followed.
  #
  # This is a log table, and should (ideally) never be updated.
  #
  # ## Indexes
  #
  # The indexes on this table are carefully chosen, as it's both big and heavily loaded.
  #
  # ### lines_scope_account_id_idx
  #
  # ```sql
  # ADD INDEX `lines_scope_account_id_idx` (scope, account, id)
  # ```
  #
  # This is the important one. It's used primarily for querying the current
  # balance of an account. eg:
  #
  # ```sql
  # SELECT * FROM `lines` WHERE scope = ? AND account = ? ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1
  # ```
  #
  # ### lines_scope_account_created_at_idx
  #
  # ```sql
  # ADD INDEX `lines_scope_account_created_at_idx` (scope, account, created_at)
  # ```
  #
  # Used for querying historic balances:
  #
  # ```sql
  # SELECT * FROM `lines` WHERE scope = ? AND account = ? AND created_at < ? ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1
  # ```
  #
  # And for reporting on account changes over a time period:
  #
  # ```sql
  # SELECT SUM(amount) FROM `lines` WHERE scope = ? AND account = ? AND created_at BETWEEN ? AND ?
  # ```
  #
  # ### lines_account_created_at_idx and lines_account_code_created_at_idx
  #
  # ```sql
  # ADD INDEX `lines_account_created_at_idx` (account, created_at);
  # ADD INDEX `lines_account_code_created_at_idx` (account, code, created_at);
  # ```
  #
  # These two are used for generating reports, which need to sum things
  # by account, or account and code, over a particular period.
