module DoubleEntry

  # Lock financial accounts to ensure consistency.
  #
  # In order to ensure financial transactions always keep track of balances
  # consistently, database-level locking is needed. This module takes care of
  # it.
  #
  # See DoubleEntry.lock_accounts and DoubleEntry.transfer for the public interface
  # to this stuff.
  #
  # Locking is done on DoubleEntry::AccountBalance records. If an AccountBalance
  # record for an account doesn't exist when you try to lock it, the locking
  # code will create one.
  #
  # script/jack_hammer can be used to run concurrency tests on double_entry to
  # validates that locking works properly.
